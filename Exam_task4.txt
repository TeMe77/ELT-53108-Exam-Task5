Task 4: The ARP problem (security) 
The ambiguity of ARP process (both in context of two hosts having mistakenly taken 
same addresses, as well as malicious misuse for MITM attacks) is a major unresolved 
issues in modern Ethernet (and Wi-Fi) networks. There are plenty of solutions proposed 
to date, but none of them appear to have been adopted widely in IPv4 networks. Your 
task is to develop a site-specific protocol, which will be adopted at a particular company 
rather than globally in the Internet. This, clearly, gives you capability to modify the hosts 
in the network, but does not give you access to modify the firmware of any switches and 
routers that you may purchase and install on the site. Overall, the protocol must enable 
the following: a client machine (e.g. employee's laptop) needs to be able to resolve the 
IP-MAC mapping for any host within the corporate network in a secure manner. It should 
be possible for the network administrators to add and remove hosts in the network 
without having to update configuration on every machine (as some employees may be at 
home during updates, and will expect their connection to "just work" when they come to 
work).
