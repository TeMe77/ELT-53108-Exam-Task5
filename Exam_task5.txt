Task 5: Submarine communications (latency)
 
In a dystopian far future humanity had to move to the deep underwater to avoid horrible 
pollution on the surface. All satellites have been lost due to massive amount of debris in 
orbit. While major settlements are connected with fiber, small submarines and people 
working underwater still need to talk. Luckily, WiFi appeared to work mostly unchanged, 
but its range was greatly limited to about 10m.  However, a variant of cellular network 
was needed that would work well underwater at longer ranges, up to 1 kilometer. As 
such, it would need to rely on ultrasound as physical layer. There are two specific issues 
with that: 
 * Speed of sound is very low compared to light speed, which delays any signaling from 
base station to mobile device a lot 
 * Bandwidths are very limited (64 frequency channels of 8 kbps each), so only voice 
communications are possible 
 You need to consider the protocols that would handle signaling related to association 
with base station, as well as handover from one base station to another (you may 
assume other procedures are taken care of). The network must be provisioned to 
support several users at the same base station at any given time.
