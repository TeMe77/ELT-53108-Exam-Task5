-	Multiplexing technique
-	-FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing) 
In FDM every user is operating in different frequency. All frequencies 
can travel at the same time across the medium. 
-	- TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)
In TDM every user is operating in same frequency but they are divided in 
different time slots so they appear to work parallel. 
-	- CDMA (Code Division Multiplexing)
In CDMA several users can use same medium and frequency at the same time. 
Users are separated with unique codes.

Submarine communications
	
-Different use cases
Submarine networking and communications can be divided for internal use 
within the ship and outbound use which includes all outbound connections 
and transmissions from the ship.
--Submarine Internal Use
Internal connections are used for gathering data from sensors all around 
the submarine and for communications within the crew.
---Systems and sensors
Internal network is used for data from sensors and access control 
devices. Sensors can send data directly with UDP-protocol and access 
control devices would work with UDP- and TCP-protocols. TCP-protocol for 
access control is chosen over UDP, because user can get confirmations 
about sent data.
---Internal Communication
Internal network for crew communications is done by wire, network is 
wired mainly by optical fiber. Fiber is chosen over copper because 
submarine have tight spaces for wiring and wiring can be done next to 
power cables with fiber (power cables can cause noise for copper cables).
--Outbound Use Cases
---Communicating with other vessels
---Communication with Base stations
