In TDM every user is operating in same frequency but they are divided in 
different time slots so they appear to work parallel. 
-	- CDMA (Code Division Multiplexing)
In CDMA several users can use same medium and frequency at the same time. 
Users are separated with unique codes.

Submarine communications
	
-Different use cases
Submarine networking and communications can be divided for internal use 
within the ship and outbound use which includes all outbound connections 
and transmissions from the ship.
--Submarine Internal Use
Internal connections are used for gathering data from sensors all around 
the submarine and for communications within the crew.
---Systems and sensors
Internal network is used for data from sensors and access control 
devices. Sensors can send data directly with UDP-protocol and access 
control devices would work with UDP- and TCP-protocols. TCP-protocol for 
access control is chosen over UDP, because user can get confirmations 
about sent data.
---Internal Communication
Internal network for crew communications is done by wire, network is 
wired mainly by optical fiber. Fiber is chosen over copper because 
submarine have tight spaces for wiring and wiring can be done next to 
power cables with fiber (power cables can cause noise for copper cables).
-Outband Use Cases
Outband communication are used for to communicate other vessels and joining to global network. 

--Communication with other vessels
Communicating with other vessels is important in many ways. Communicating with other vessel we could use message-based systems with for example techniques like SMS (Short Message Service) or anything like that. SMS is widely used in mobile devices. SMS are used in techniques like GSM. Benefit to use low radio wawes in submarine is that low frequency traffic is transported in water better than high frequency traffic. 
Another communicating type could be internet calls like VoIP and videocalls. VoIP and videocalls could be used when there is important negotions in the dock between submarines where there are better connections to other vessels. Long distance calls we could use for example low frequency calls directly to other vessels or via base station

It is important that submarine knows other vessels position, estimated route and status. In example radar could terminate position of other vessels. Radar sends radio wawes and waits it to echo back and counts the postion of other vessels. Radar could use both TCP and UDP protocols based from the application requirements. Some radar systems can tolerate packet loss and reordering packets. Then you could use UDP based design in you system. Using UDP-based postitioning system is more precise and faster determinig postitions. On the otherhand  if you application do not tolerate packet loss or reorderin packets then you have to use TCP-based design. Benefits to use TCP-based system is that it won't consume so much resources because fewer amount of packets are transferred but determinating positioning and estimated route takes more time that UDP-based system.

Systems that are used for communicating another vessels and radar systems are critical traffic from a submarine perspective. Those two types of communication is important that they have on frequency which they operate. Congested frequency could cause packetloss, delay, jitter and loss of signal.
