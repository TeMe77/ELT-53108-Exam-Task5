Submarine communications

-Cellular networks

--History of mobile network:
Fist generation (1G) mobile technology such as NMT, enabled users to 
carry phone without cable connected for it. There were two major problems 
in this approach. Connections used analogue signals to transfer data to 
receiver, that was error prone way to transfer data because analogue 
signal is more sensitive to interference than digital signal. Other 
problem was that First generation used FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple 
Access) modulation technique to reserve frequency from base stations, 
which reserved available spectrum inefficient way.

---NMT (Nordiska MobileTelefongruppen) first used frequency band
of 450MHz but when capacity was running out 900MHz frequency band was
introduced in many countries to NMT use.

---Second generation (2G) mobile technology such as GSM, CDMA and EDGE 
used modulation techniques such as TDMA and CDMA. 2G also introduced data 
service (50Kbps) and internet browsing.

---GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) first used
frequency band of 900MHz, but when capacity was running out, 1800MHz
frequency band was introduced in many countries for GSM to use. Also, 
850MHz and 1900MHz was introduced to use in some countries (mainly in 
USA). Overall frequency bands used for GSM were 850MHz, 900MHz, 1850MHz 
and 1900MHz.

----Third generation (3G) mobile technology such as WCDMA and HSPA are
focused to give higher data transfer speed and increased bandwidth
(2Mbps). Higher data speed allows user to have GPS and videocalls. In 3G 
WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) is used. 3G was a great 
step moving from basic phone to smartphone.

---HSPA (High-Speed Packet Access) has few standards itself HSDPA
(High Speed Downlink Packet Access), HSUPA (High Speed Uplink Packet
Access) and HSPA+ (HSPA Evolved). HSPA uses almost same frequency bands
than GSM. Frequency bands used are 850MHz and 1900MHz.

---Fourth generation (4G) mobile technology such as WiMAX data speed 20-
100Mbps was suitable for high resolution speed movies and television.
This higher speed was made possible modulation technique OFDMA
(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) and antenna technique
MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output). MIMO uses multiple antennas inside
to communication both end devices and base stations. WiMAX (Worldwide 
Interoperability for Microwave Access) used frequency band of 20 GHz - 66 
GHz and data speed can be up to 75 Mbps.

---Fifth generation (5G) data speed is estimated to be 10Gbps. 5G uses 
enhanced MIMO technology and millimeter waves. It will support seamless 
connectivity to support the internet of things such as driverless cars 
and smart homes.

Thoughts how this information helps us planning underwater connections, 
the lower the used signal frequency is, the farther signals will travel. 
Underwater signal won't travel so far than it would in air, so that means 
we cannot directly compare signal travel length underwater and, in the 
air, but the principle is the same.

The higher the used signal frequency is the bigger transmission capacity 
is.

The better the coding in signal multiplexing technique and better antenna 
technique is used the better quality, reliability and more capacity in 
signal is.

--Roaming
Roaming in mobile network is that vessels communication is transferred 
from one base station to another base station and hopefully without 
connection to disconnect. In submarine it is important that your 
connection won't disconnect, and vessel always have connection if it is 
available. It is another thing if vessel sails somewhere where are no 
networks available, this can also be if vessel can’t use roaming to join 
new network.

-Multiplexing
Multiplexing means that when two or more signals combines and use the 
same channel for transmission.  

--Multiplexing techniques

--- FDMA (Frequency Division Multiplexing Access)
In FDM every user is operating in different frequency. All frequencies can travel at the same time across the medium. For example, FDMA was used in the First generation (1G) mobile techniques. Problem with this technique was that it reserves the channel for users in the base station area so bandwidth for active users. Because of this frequency band is not effectively used in this technique, because there is need to have guard bands between used band which were allocated to users, that was done because signals wouldnâ€™t mix with each other. This multiplexing technique suffered from intersymbol interference (ISI). ISI is phenomenon where previous symbols have similar effect, which makes communication less reliable.

--- TDMA (Time Division Multiplexing Access)
In TDM every user is operating in same frequency, but users are divided in different time slots, so they appear to work parallel. TDMA was used in second generation (2G) mobile telecommunication technology such as GSP, GSRP and EDGE. Comment about this technique that there was no guard band and when users had their own timeslot, they could use the whole spectrum but if the transmission didnt fit in the timeslot they would have to wait next one.  

--- CDMA (Code Division Multiplexing Access) and 
In CDMA several users can use same medium and frequency at the same time. Users are separated from each other with unique codes. CDMA is used in third generation (3G) mobile telecommunication technology such as CDMA. If there is multiple users in the area then there is multiple code to register the users. This multiplexing technique suffered from intersymbol interference (ISI) ISI is phenomenon where previous symbols have similar effect, which makes communication less reliable and that can cause Limitations less data rate, congestion, resources waste, bandwidth efficiency.

--- OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)
In OFDMA different numbers of sub-carriers where users are allocated which signals are orthogonal to each other. OFDMA can be thought as a combination with FDMA and TDMA. OFDM is used in Fourth generation (4G) mobile telecommunication technologies such as LTE. OFDMA dont require guard band like FDMA. In OFDMA there are no such big problem in frequency mix than FDMA. When there is no guard band required data speed can be larger. When OFDMA is compared to FDMA, TDMA and CDMA there is more data rate and more reliable data transfer than previously previewed modulation technologies. 

	
--Different use cases
Submarine networking and communications can be divided for internal use 
inside the ship and outbound use, which includes all outbound connections 
and transmissions from the ship.

--Submarine Internal Use
Internal connections can be used for gathering data from sensors all 
around the submarine and for communications within the vessel’s crew. 
Sensors doesn’t need high bit rates, voice communication and data 
transfers from the crew are high priority and need high data rate.

---Systems and sensors
Internal network is used for data from sensors and access control 
devices. Sensors can send data directly with UDP-protocol and access 
control devices would work with UDP- and TCP-protocols. TCP-protocol for 
access control is chosen over UDP because user can get confirmations 
about sent data. Sensors are continuously updating data about state of 
submarine and its premises. Vessel have control room and server premises 
for all data gathering and monitoring.

---Internal Communication
Internal network for crew communications is done by wire, network is 
wired mainly by optical fiber. Fiber is chosen over copper because 
submarine have tight spaces for wiring and wiring can be done next to 
power cables with fiber (power cables can cause noise for copper cables). 
Internal communication could be done by Wi-Fi also, but it needs wired 
core network in every section of submarine. Wi-Fi coverage can be 
achieved by adding access points to every section of vessel.

---- Wi-Fi for submarine and it’s challenges
Wi-Fi network is fast and decently reliable to use for fixed size of 
area, but it comes with great challenges as we talk about submarine use. 
Vessel is divided into many sections and it forces to have minimum one 
access point per section and all of them connected by wire. Even if all 
of vessel’s sections would be open and powerful Wi-Fi antennas are in 
use, sections can act as faraday cage and block connection between 
sections. While Wi-Fi could be more flexible to use inside submarines 
sections, wired connection would be still preferable choice due to its 
reliability.

-Outbound communications 
Outbound communications are used to communicate with other vessels and 
joining to global network. Data is transferred mostly by cellular 
networks, but also Wi-Fi can be used in close range transfers.

--Communication with other vessels
Communicating with other vessels is always important to maintain. For 
communicating with other vessels, vessel could use message-based systems,
techniques like SMS (Short Message Service) or anything like that. SMS is 
widely used in mobile devices. SMS are used in techniques like GSM. 
Benefit to use low frequency radio waves in submarine is because low 
frequency waves travel in water much better than high frequency waves. 
Another communication type could be internet calls like VoIP and 
videocalls. VoIP and videocalls could be used when there are important 
communications between submarines at dock, at dock there are better 
connections to other vessels because base stations could be located at 
docks. For long distance calls vessel could use low frequency connections 
directly to other vessel or via base station.

It is important that submarine knows position of other vessel, its 
planned route and status. For example, radar could give information about 
position of other vessels. Radar sends radio waves and waits environment 
to echo waves back and counts the position of other vessels. Radar could 
use both TCP and UDP protocols based from the application requirements. 
Some radar systems can tolerate packet loss and reordering packets. Then 
vessel could use UDP based design in vessels system. Using UDP-based 
positioning system is more precise and faster determining positions, but 
if the used application does not tolerate any packet loss or reordering 
packets, then it must use TCP-based design. Benefits to use TCP-based 
system is that it won't consume so much resources because fewer number of 
packets are transferred but determination of positioning and estimated 
route takes more time that UDP-based system.

Systems that are used for communicating another vessels and radar 
systems, those are critical traffic from a submarine perspective. Those 
two types of communications are important that they are on frequency 
which they operate. Congested frequency could cause packet loss, delay, 
jitter, and loss of signal.

Submarines could use multi-path technologies to gain higher data rates in 
close connections. Faster network can be achieved by summarizing two 
technologies together as multi-path. Submarines could use low frequency 
Wi-Fi antennas and cellular technologies at same time while communicating 
between ships or base stations. When vessel is out of Wi-Fi range vessel 
will only communicate through cellular network and send only necessary 
packets. Default choice for network are cellular technologies and Wi-Fi 
as secondary.

--Communication with cellular network
Basically, almost all communication from submarine is going throw base 
stations, good example for connection is cellular networks. In exceptions 
vessel will use radar systems and communication systems that directly 
connected vessel-to-vessel. If there comes such a time, dystopia or 
utopia and there comes need to implement large scale cellular network in 
the ocean, there is important to note that cells need to have decent 
connection to each other. This will need high power antennas and new 
implementations for low frequency band. There must be adequate signal to 
other cells that users(submarines) won't suffer from bad quality 
connection what could cause packet loss, jitter, and packet delay. 

There are many technologies which can be used in cellular networks. For 
example, vessel could be using GSM, GPRS, CDMA, EDGE, UMTS, 3G, 4G or 5G 
technologies. One important thing to remember in water, is that low 
frequency travels much better than high frequency techniques, in water 
radios waves have much shorter distance than those would be in air. 
Multiplexing techniques such as FDM, TDM and CDMA enables users to 
communicate at the same time using same channel.
		

-- Cellular networks for submarine communication
Cellular networks are easy way to transfer huge amounts of data in mobile 
environment. Cellular technologies, fourth generation (4G) and fifth 
generation (5G) are in common use and reliable on land, but it doesn’t 
give much for underwater use. Newest high data rate cellular technologies 
use high frequencies with low effective range and tight mesh network. Due 
to physics of radio waves in water, high frequencies have extremely low 
range in water environment and are not effective to use. Seawater does 
have great absorption and is very conductive for high frequencies which 
makes low frequencies more commonly used.
